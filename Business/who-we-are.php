						Blue Lynx Technical, Inc. initially began as kind of a joke amongst an extremely talented small group of friends that over time came to the realization that together there was no limits to what they could accomplish. 
						Blue Lynx Technical (BLT) stands for Bill, Liz, and Todd. Each of the founding members is a subject matter expert in his/her respective area (Cypherpath SDI OS, Systems Engineering / Learning Management Systems, and Curriculum Development). 
						We also have well established relationships and a good reputation within Cypherpath Incorporated and through many of our suggestions have helped mature the Cypherpath Product.</p>

							<h2>Our Methodology</h2>
							<p>
								We utilize an informal agile methodology that centers on quality communication and rapid iterative prototyping. We start with an idea, develop a proof of concept, roughly define the scope, get customer buy in, and continue to refine and demonstrate until the product perfectly matches customer needs.

							<h2>The Culture</h2>
							<p>
								Our talent is the backbone of the organization. Being almost entirely made up of veterans or individuals with extensive experience in the defense industry, we pride ourselves on our respectful but light hearted work environment that values not only perseverance and hard work but also teamwork. We don’t like to fail and you can be assured that when we commit to something we’re not going to leave you high and dry when things get difficult – instead we rally.
